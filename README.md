# NFT Marketplace

## Created an Celo NFT marketplace built with etherjs and deployed with hardhat.
I wanted to test out if utilizing etherjs only to communicate with the celo network, was feasible without celo contractKit in building a NFT marketplace. I am glad it worked.

I also wrote code to help deploy the contract to the marketplace, and dynamically save the contract address. In `scripts\deploy.js` file

Usage
Install the CeloExtensionWallet from the google chrome store.
Create a wallet.
Go to https://celo.org/developers/faucet and get tokens for the alfajores testnet.
Switch to the alfajores testnet in the CeloExtensionWallet.
